# LandingSequence
This is a small project/prototype in Unity for an idea I thought would be fun for a casual game, possibly mobile.

## Basics
- You have a spaceship with 2 thrusters and you control each of them separately (Keys A and D or <- and ->).
- The ship is not indestructible, if it hits too hard, or on a critical spot, on the ground or walls,
it will be destroyed.
- You can leave the ship and walk freely but there is no point on doing so yet (Key E or F).
